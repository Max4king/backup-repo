# backup-repo
This is to prevent the unexpected of the dependency being deleted.

## llama-cpp-python
The first one here is the llama-cpp-python. The hardest package to install for me so far. It is such a pain to install it with the cuBlas on window.


# Disclaimer
I do not own any of the file in this repo unless stated otherwise. Use it at your own discretion. I am not reliable for any potential harm of the product here.

### Note
This repo may not be the latest version of the program and other things due to me not updating it often. I would only update it if there is a good reason to. i.e. An major improvement of the program or a request to.
If it doesn't break, why update it.
